The implemented MIPS processor consists of several interconnected modules that work together to execute MIPS instructions in a single clock cycle

Program Counter (PC): Maintains the address of the current instruction
ALU: Performs arithmetic and logical operations
Control Unit: Generates control signals based on instruction opcode
Register File: Stores temporary data
Data Memory: Stores program data
Instruction Memory: Stores program instructions

# Instruction Support
# R-Type Instructions
Arithmetic: ADD, SUB
Logical: AND, OR
Shifts: SLL, SRL, SRA

# I-Type Instructions
Memory: LW (Load Word), SW (Store Word)
Immediate: ADDI, ANDI, ORI

# Branch: 
BEQ (Branch if Equal), BNE (Branch if Not Equal)

# J-Type Instructions
J (Jump)
